    "In **Exercise 19**, you learned how to define functions and their input arguments. You also got the first glimpse at the difference between variables defined inside a function (**local variables**) and variables defined outside a function, running in the main, unindented script (**global variables**).\n",

    "You will also learn to combine these skills with what you learned in **Exercises 14 and 15** about reading and writing files. Where **Exercise 19** passed *variables* into functions as an input argument between the brackets, **Exercise 20** looks at how to pass *files* into functions as input arguments.\n",
