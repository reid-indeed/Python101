    "# Exercise 13 - Running Command Line Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "***NOTE - this exercise is a little longer than earlier exercises.***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*You might not need it right now, but it is a very worthwhile skill to have in your broader programming adventures.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Take the time to tackle this exercise when you are at peak excitement for enhancing your Python skills!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything that you have learned about Python and applied in this exercise book has been (hopefully) well-behaved and self-contained inside the exercise book itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one of the most powerful tools in Python and related programming languages is the ability to **reuse chunks of code from elsewhere**. In other words, you can `import` existing code into your own program and use it as part of your own program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In coding terminology, we say that you can `import` a **module** into your program. This keeps your own program as small and simple as possible while, at the same time, unleashing the power of the pre-prepared code written in the **module** you have just imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An analogy that might help you understand `import`\n",
    "\n",
    "As you explore the Python language beyond your initial training, you will also hear people in the community refer to importing a **library** as well as importing a **module**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about this like you are a writer visiting a library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have a blank page that you want to fill with your own creative thoughts and spellbinding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To write your own words on the blank page, you borrow and seek inspiration from certain passages from books available in the library you are sitting in. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You take some books from the shelves, you take notes on the passages in those books that are helpful to you, and then you write on your own blank page. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Once you're finished with the books you borrowed, you can put them back on the shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if the library you are sitting in doesn't have a book you are looking for, you can go to another library to find it. \n",
    "In the second library, you can once again borrow quotes and passages and styles from books on the shelves, using them to fill your own pages with your own creative combinations of words. \n",
    "Once you're finished with the books in the second library, you can return them to the shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Python program can be written using creative combinations of functions (book and passages) available in code modules (libraries) that you `import` into your program.**"
